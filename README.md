# Animate-your-name-dashboard

This is a friendly UI to create a grid of zeros and ones. Follow [this link](https://animate-your-name-dashboard.vercel.app/) to access the dashboard.

# Motivation

In the repo [animate-your-name-using-matplotlib](https://github.com/Badr-MOUFAD/animate_your_name), it was mandatory to input a grid filled with zeros and ones to the algo so that to animate the figure.

However, it is a bit complicated to generate such grids either manually or by code, especially for complex figures.

In light of that, I resolved to create a UI that will ease the creation of such grids.

# Usage

To create a figure all you need to do is:

1. Set the grid dimension by specifying the number of rows and columns

2. Draw your figure using your mouse curser. If you make a mistake do not worry, you can switch to eraser mode.

3. After finishing, export your Grid, et Voilà!
